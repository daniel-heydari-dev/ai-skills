## Refactoring Goals

2. **Maintainability** - Make code easier to modify
3. **Performance** - Improve efficiency where beneficial
4. **Testability** - Make code easier to test

## Output Format

````
## Current Issues

1. **[Issue Name]**
   - Problem: [description]

```[language]
// Refactored implementation
````

## Changes Made

| Change     | Before | After | Reason |

## Refactoring Principles

1. **Small steps** - One change at a time
2. **Test first** - Ensure tests exist before refactoring
3. **Preserve behavior** - No functional changes
4. **Explain reasoning** - Document why each change improves the code
```
